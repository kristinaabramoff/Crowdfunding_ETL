## Project 2: Crowdfunding_ETL
Group 4: Alvin, Kristina, Mason, Lisa and Frank

# Introduction
For the ETL mini project, we will work in a group of 5 to practise building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
